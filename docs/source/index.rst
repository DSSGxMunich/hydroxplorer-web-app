Firstly, you can add a point of interest in two ways:

**Interactively**: Double-click on the point of interest on the map.

**Search**: Use the  search button and type the desired address.

As soon as you select a point on the map, a pop-up window will appear with the following required input:

1. **Hose Length**: Expects a numerical value.

2. **Transport Mode**:
  *Walking*: Route optimized for walkers.

  *Driving*: Driving directions for motor vehicles.

  *Cycling*: Fits Portable Fire Pump Trolley.

  *Service Driving*: Drivable public streets (incl. service roads).

3. **Point Type**: Select whether the point is a fire or a water source.

Secondly, use the ``Submit`` button to use the tool. In case of an error, keep in mind the input values restriction.

Input Values Restriction:
=========================
